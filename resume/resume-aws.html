    <p>I joined IAG Accelerator Business (internally scaled disruptor) to assist with maturing the platform and its controls. Accelerator Business offers Motor Insurance (Poncho Reference) supported by the first low-cost Cloud end-to-end platform environment within IAG. My role was to run Cloud, Technical and Risk Governance within the team and represent our area to the various Governance bodies within IAG. I also led several initiatives, which covered the setup of a Snowflake as a Cloud Data Lake, performance tuning of the quote and buy customer experience and oversaw the migration to SaaS-based CI / CD tooling.</p>
    <p>Key achievements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Managed ten people in a cross-divisional and multi-platform project for the implementation of the enterprise's first Cloud Data Lake (Snowflake); this provided an analytical capability to the business to make data-driven decisions in real-time</li>
      <li>Integrated Accelerator Business issue tracking reporting system into the Enterprise ServiceNow issue tracking system, which reduced administrative overhead and reduced organisational risk</li>
      <li>Increased the number of policies sold by improving the response time on the Poncho Insurance website. As a result Customer Engagement increased by 25%</li>
      <li>Implemented a monitoring and reporting framework with the use of Splunk, New Relic, ServiceNow and Slack, which led to a decrease in outages and issues</li>
    </ul>
    
<h3><strong>Cloud Adoption Manager &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2018 - 2020</strong></h3>
<p>I established the Cloud Adoption team to help project teams move workloads to the Cloud.   The team was composed of 10 people from across the governance and technical areas of IAG.  I led the development and role of an enterprise-wide Cloud Adoption Methodology across Australia, New Zealand and Singapore.  This involved aligning the Cloud Adoption framework to existing IAG Enterprise Standards, including Risk, Data, Cyber and Operations.  The area grew from a greenfield site to support over 40 concurrent workloads.  These workloads ranged from static websites to End to End Cloud Based Insurance platforms.</p>
<p>Key achievements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created a reporting framework for Senior Management on the activities within Enterprise Cloud Adoption Framework.</li>
<li>Worked with Cloud vendors on how best to implement their products and services into the Enterprise-wide Cloud Adoption framework, resulting in quicker time to market.</li>
<li>Established strategic and operational workloads onto AWS, SaaS, and Azure Cloud platforms, avoiding capital expenditure by moving this infrastructure to an op-ex model and increasing the Enterprise's capability to innovate with new technologies.</li>
<li>Delivered IAG's first SaaS System of Record in the Cloud with the start-up disruptor brand Poncho Insurance.</li>
<li>Reduced duration of Cloud Adoption delivery times from 9 months to under ten weeks by creating technical patterns of technical reuse.</li>
<li>Developed & introduced the change in the way IAG adopts Cloud Technologies within tightly regulated internal and external environments.</li>
<li>Established and educated across IAG on the new Cloud Framework, which increased compliance for the workload and reduced the number of risks.</li>
